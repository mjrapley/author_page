<p align="center">I open my eyes, after what feels like an eternity,

<p align="center">and look again, awash with feelings of disbelief.

<p align="center">The satin red lining rippled like the frozen surface of a disturbed pond,

<p align="center">surrounded by a timber dark and luxurious, rich in texture and hue,

<p align="center">raised up on hinges that I know will not squeak when they pivot closed,

<p align="center">and allowing those without, to look within, the stoic casket.

<p align="center">It brings to mind wonderings of a life that might have been,

<p align="center">of meetings that may have blossomed into true love,

<p align="center">of experiences never to be enjoyed,

<p align="center">tastes never to be savoured,

<p align="center">sensations never to be felt.

<p align="center">I stare at the mocking open lid, knowing it is trying to tell me something,

<p align="center">something I’ve missed, something elusive that I have not yet grasped,

<p align="center">something I must know but have refused to acknowledge.

<p align="center">My mind bores into it with all the might I can muster,

<p align="center">exerting my will to force it open more yet, slam it back against the casket side,

<p align="center">ensure that the finality that comes with the closing of it never comes to pass.

<p align="center">But as I focus, so the world becomes less clear.

<p align="center">First about the edges, softening and blurring,

<p align="center">as when sleep closes in after an exhausting day

<p align="center">when you long to stay awake,

<p align="center">then narrowing down, honing my view,

<p align="center">leaving only a tunnel of light through which to observe in horror

<p align="center">as the casket lid is lowered.

<p align="center">And it is in this moment that that unknown truth

<p align="center">became terrifyingly to light -

<p align="center">the casket closes now on I. </p>

<p align="center">I remember your finals words to me,

<p align="center">cold and indifferent,

<p align="center">thrown back over your shoulder

<p align="center">as you walked casually away,

<p align="center">your heels clicking on the driveway:

<p align="center">“You should have seen this coming.”

<p align="center">In all honesty I did,

<p align="center">though I was afraid to admit it,

<p align="center">even to myself.

<p align="center">It was reflected in your eyes,

<p align="center">the way you’d look at me

<p align="center">and then right past me,

<p align="center">as if you couldn’t bear your gaze

<p align="center">to rest upon the sight of your guilt.

<p align="center">It was in the way you held me,

<p align="center">our embraces no longer strong and warm,

<p align="center">but brief and efficient,

<p align="center">like hugging an unfamiliar Great Uncle.

<p align="center">It was in your voice,

<p align="center">in the way you spoke,

<p align="center">the tones you’d use,

<p align="center">and the way you’d snap simple comments.

<p align="center">But mostly I should have seen it coming,

<p align="center">buried not in the words you chose,

<p align="center">but rather in the words that you failed to choose,

<p align="center">and not hearing those words,

<p align="center">those three simple, meaningful words,

<p align="center">should have warned me clearly that the end was nigh. </p>

<p align="center">The bitterness seems rooted deep within,

<p align="center">bound to the very core of my being,

<p align="center">unyielding and enduring,

<p align="center">everlasting and perpetual,

<p align="center">forever a radio beacon transmitting,

<p align="center">it’s waves and signals twisting my mind.

<p align="center">Even with a smile on my lips and a gleam in my eye,

<p align="center">as joy enters my day and takes me by the hand,

<p align="center">still I am tainted with that bitterness,

<p align="center">and the corners of the smile tighten a little,

<p align="center">the gleam edged with the faint trace of a tear.

<p align="center">Permeating through all

<p align="center">soaking

<p align="center">enveloping

<p align="center">saturating

<p align="center">engulfing

<p align="center">every essence of my soul.

<p align="center">Like a plovers’ call echoing through the day,

<p align="center">into the dusk and evening,

<p align="center">long past midnight,

<p align="center">through the early morning

<p align="center">and on to the faintest dawn of a new day and beyond,

<p align="center">so the bitterness is my everything and my all,

<p align="center">every passing second

<p align="center">of each long minute

<p align="center">stained with a pain inescapable.</p>
